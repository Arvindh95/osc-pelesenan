# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Module M02 â€“ Permohonan Lesen oleh Pemohon extends the OSC Pelesenan PBT System to enable verified applicants (Pemohon) to create, manage, and submit license applications to local authorities (PBT) for processing. This module builds upon Module M01 (Profil Pelanggan), which provides authentication, identity verification, company management, and audit logging capabilities. The system is developed using Laravel 10 (PHP 8.2) with MySQL 8 database.

## Implementation Notes

### Status Labels vs Backend State

- Backend workflow state on submission is **Diserahkan**
- UI may display the label **"Permohonan Baru"** in application lists for user clarity
- This is a presentation-layer label only and does not affect backend state management

### Payment and Auto-Cancel Logic

- Payment processing and auto-cancel timers are handled by **Module 10**
- Module M02 must not implement payment or timeout logic
- Module M02 is responsible only for application creation, editing, and submission to PBT

### File Upload Configuration

- Default maximum upload size: **10 MB**
- Configurable via `config('files.max_upload_size', 10 * 1024 * 1024)`
- Allowed file types: **PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG**

### Module 4 Integration

- Jenis Lesen catalog is dynamic and retrieved from Module 4
- Document requirements (keperluan_dokumen) are associated with license types, not separate license types themselves
- Cache keperluan_dokumen for 15 minutes to reduce API calls
- Development environments should provide fallback data when Module 4 is unavailable

### Antivirus Scanning

- Document upload emits **DokumenDimuatNaik** event
- If AV scanning is enabled, a scan job is queued on event handling
- AV scanning is optional and controlled by system configuration
